Hi!

My name is Nilton. 
I'm Data Engineer Analyst.

Live in Recife, State of Pernambuco, Brazil.

Have degree in Information Systems at Uninassau.

I'm also a Postgraduate (MBA) in Business Intelligence Analysis at Institute of Management and Information Technology - IGTI.

Currently taking another postgraduate course (Specialization) in Data Analysis and Engineering at CESAR School in partnership with the Informatics Center at the Federal University of Pernambuco - CIn/UFPE.

Here you will find my data analysis putting into practice the knowledge acquired mainly in the specialization in progress at CESAR School. 

Access the files in the "notebooks" folder to view my data analysis, which I apply exploratory data analysis, classification models, clustering, and machine learning algorithms.

I appreciate your visit.
